# IRIS GPU Bench

## A GPU Monitoring And Carbon Calculation Tool For Containerized Benchmarks

## Brief Overview
The GPU Monitoring and Carbon Calculation Tool tracks GPU performance and carbon emissions during benchmarks.

The tool monitors GPU metrics in real-time, estimates carbon emissions using the National Grid ESO API, and optionally exports data to VictoriaMetrics. It integrates with Docker for containerized environments and offers a customizable command-line interface for monitoring and live plotting. Real-time logging is also supported.

Ideal for evaluating GPU application performance, measuring environmental impact, and optimizing GPU performance.
