If you need to build Docker images for benchmarking, you can use the provided `build_images.sh` script. This script will build images defined in the `Benchmark_Docker` directory. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

1. **Navigate to the Docker Directory**:
   Go to the `Benchmark_Docker` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Benchmark_Docker
   ```

2. **Run the Build Script**:
   Execute the build script to build all Docker images:
   ```bash
   ./build_images.sh
   ```

   This script will build Docker images from the Dockerfiles located in `Benchmark_Docker/Benchmark_Dockerfiles`. Feel Free to add your own. The available Dockerfiles and their purposes are:

   - **Base Images**:
     - `Dockerfile.gpu_base`: Base image for GPU-based benchmarks.
     - `Dockerfile.sciml_base`: Base image for SciML benchmarks.
     - `Dockerfile.mantid_base`: Base image for Mantid imaging benchmarks.
   
   - **Mantid Imaging Benchmarks**:
     - `Dockerfile.mantid_run_1`: Dockerfile for Mantid benchmark run 1GB.
     - `Dockerfile.mantid_run_8`: Dockerfile for Mantid benchmark run 8GB.
   
   - **SciML Benchmarks**:
     - `Dockerfile.mnist_tf_keras`: Dockerfile for MNIST classification Benchmark using TensorFlow/Keras.
     - `Dockerfile.stemdl_classification_2gpu`: Dockerfile for STEMDL classification using 1 GPU
     - `Dockerfile.stemdl_classification_2gpu`: Dockerfile for STEMDL classification using 2 GPUs (There must be 2 available).
     - `Dockerfile.synthetic_regression`: Dockerfile for synthetic regression benchmarks.
    
   - **Dummy Benchmark Container**:
     - `Dockerfile.dummy`: Designed for testing purposes, this Dockerfile sets up a container that runs for 5 minutes before terminating. It is primarily used to profile the GPU resource usage of this monitoring tool. Ideally, the monitor should operate in isolation from the benchmarks to avoid interference. However, currently, the monitor runs in the background on the same VM as the benchmark containers, which poses scalability limitations. To address this in the future, Docker Compose could be used to manage multiple containers simultaneously, but this would require an SSH-based solution to monitor them from an external VM.

This setup will prepare the environment and Docker images required for running your benchmarks effectively.
